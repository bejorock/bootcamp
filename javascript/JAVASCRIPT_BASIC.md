# Javascript Basic

## Intro to Programming

- Computer (bytecode and instructions)
  - Computer is a machine that can translate instructions into set of functionality
  - Bytecode is a language that computer can understand to read for next instruction (0 and 1)
  - Every instruction is stored in either memory or cache
- Programmming Language
  - A language to bridge between human language and computer instruction
  - Sample of primitive language is assembly
  - High level language is more understandable to human
- Interpreter & Compiler
  - A tool to convert instruction in programming language to instruction in bytecode
  - Interpreter is different than compiler.
  - Interpreter do interpret programming language to bytecode at runtime.
  - Compiler do compile programming language to bytecode at buildtime.
- What is javascript?
  - An interpreter language
  - Based on single core execution.
  - Execution is queued and executed for each event loop. (per tick)
  - High level language
  - Everything is object
  - Functions is firstclass citizen.
  - Works in browser or server.
  - Use V8 runtime and garbage collector.
  - Typesafe (no pointer)
