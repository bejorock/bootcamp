# Values, Types and Operators

## Values

computer works can only works in data. data is stored in computer as bytecode.

values is a byte chunk of data represented in bytes. every value has a type which computer can act according to its type characteristic.

primitive values in javascript are string, number, boolean

in memory values are stored in byte chunks and every chunk has an address. in javascript when a value is assigned to a variable, the variable holds only its address in memory.

when performing computation of a value referenced by a variable, javascript runtime will access a chunk in memory by its address and load its content for computation.

examples of values

```
"Hello world" // string value

3 // number value
2.4 // number value

true // boolean value
false // boolean value
```

### Excercise

[TODO]

## Types

Javascript primitive types are string, number, and boolean.

There are some advance builtin types such as Object, Array, Symbol and Date.

There are also special numbers such as NaN, Infinite

String type

```
var stringVariable = "this is a string";
```

Number type

```
var numberVariable = 10;
var nanVariable = NaN;
var infiniteVariable = Infinite;
```

Boolean type

```
var booleanVariable = true;
```

Object type

```
var objectVariable = { name: "fulan", age: 10 };
```

Array type

```
var arrayVariable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Symbol type

```
var symbolVariable = Symbol("NAME")
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic

assign value to a variable

```
var a = "this is a new variable"
var x = 10, y = 20;
var b = a; // b will have a value
```

addition

```
var sum = 10 + 10; // 20

var a = 20;
var b = 20;

var c = a + b; // 40
```

substraction

```
var sum = 20 - 10; // 10

var a = 20;
var b = 10;

var c = a - b; // 10
```

multiplication

```
var sum = 10 * 10; // 100

var a = 10;
var b = 10;

var c = a * b; // 100
```

division

```
var sum = 10 / 10; // 1

var a = 10;
var b = 10;

var c = a / b; // 1
```

### Unary

typeof

```
console.log(typeof "a string"); // string
console.log(typeof 10); // number
console.log(typeof true); // boolean
```

negation

```
console.log(- (10 + 10)); // -20
```
